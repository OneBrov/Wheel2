My home project with some random game generator working on react (frontend) and django (backend).

Actually I already have this project, but i want to make some significant improvements. improvement. There they are:

Front end now in react.
Now I using bootstrab 5 for styles page. And page looks actually nice
Now site must be SPA. And for this I made API on the back
At all most of the code be rewrite and now it's definitely different project
